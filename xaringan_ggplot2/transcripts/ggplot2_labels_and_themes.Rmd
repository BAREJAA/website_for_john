# Slide 1
In this talk you will learn how to make improvements to your ggplot by adding layers and adjusting themes

# Slide 2
Let's begin with this simple scatterplot with a regression line. We see that the default x- and y-axis labels are just the corresponding variable names. Let's see how we can make them look nicer

# Slide 3
First we change the x-axis label. For this we can use the `labs()` function and we set x = "Logged GDP Per Capita" to replace the underscores with spaces and capitalize everything

# Slide 4
Similarly, to change the y-axis label we set y = "Ladder Score", and we get this
- [show plot]

# Slide 5
We can also use the `labs()` function to add a title, like this
- [show plot]

# Slide 6
And finally, let's add a caption to show what the data source is.
- The caption is positioned on the bottom right-hand corner

# Slide 7
Ggplot's default settings are a little drab. To quickly change multiple theme settings at once, we can use one of many theme functions by just adding them as another layer. For example, let's take a look at what `theme_minimal()` does
- Much cleaner! There are ways to make specific adjustments to every aspect of the plot, but these theme functions offer a quick and pain-free way to do this
- There you go - you now know how to make your plots more informative and look prettier by changing the labels and themes
