## Faceting {.build}
Faceting allows you to create multiple graphs side by side in one panel. Especially useful when you want to see the data together, but not on top of each other  
  
For example:  
  
`ggplot(`r dataframe_name`) +`  
`geom_point(aes(x=`r df_char1_name`, y=`r df_numeric1_name`)) +`  
`facet_grid(cols = vars(`r df_char2_name`))`

## Faceting
```{r facetting, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(df_input, aes(!!sym(df_char1_name), !!sym(df_numeric1_name))) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(!!sym(df_char2_name)))
```
  
*This is especially useful for exploratory data analysis
