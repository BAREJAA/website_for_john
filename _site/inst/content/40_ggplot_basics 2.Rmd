## Basics of a ggplot code {.build}

Below is an example of the most basic form of the ggplot code  
  
`ggplot(data = dataframe) +`   
  `geom(mapping = aes(x, y))`  
  
Take a moment to look back at the code template.  You can see that in that code we assigned a `dataset` and the information we needed to `map` it to a type of plot

## Basics of a ggplot code {.build}
  
`ggplot(data = `r dataframe_name`) +`  
`geom_point(mapping=aes(x = `r df_numeric1_name`, y = `r df_numeric2_name`))`  
  
```{r simple_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df_input %>% 
  ggplot(aes(!!sym(df_numeric1_name), !!sym(df_numeric2_name))) +
  geom_point() 
```

## Build a `ggplot` {.build}
- "Initialize" a plot with `ggplot()`  
  
`ggplot(data = `r dataframe_name`) +`  
  
- Add layers with `geom_functions`  
  
`geom_point(mapping=aes(x = `r df_numeric1_name`, y = `r df_numeric2_name`))`  

## Notes on `ggplot` style {.build}
- Generally, different people have **strong** opinions about style and data visualization  
  
- Data visualization is a rich and complex area of study and is beyond the scope of this introductory course  
  
**That being said, here are a few style tips:**    
- While you can put the `+` at the beginning of the next line, it is generally put at the end of the previous line    
  
- Arguments do not need to be explicit: this chunk of code is equivalent to the previous chunk (w/ data, mappings)  
`ggplot(`r dataframe_name`) +`    
`geom_point(aes(x = `r df_numeric2_name`, y = `r df_numeric2_name`))`
