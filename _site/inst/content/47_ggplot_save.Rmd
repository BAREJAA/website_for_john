## Saving plots using `ggsave` {.build}

If you make a plot there are a few ways to save it, though the simplest is to use `ggsave`  

`ggsave("ggsaveexample.png", plot = last_plot())`  

You can change the type of file you save or the size.  
  
`ggsave("ggsaveexample.pdf", plot = my_awesome_object, width = 6, height = 6, units = "cm")`
