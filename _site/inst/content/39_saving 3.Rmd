## Saving a new dataset as an object

If you'd like to save the output of your wrangling as an object, you will need to use the `<-` operator

``r dataframe_name`_new <- `r dataframe_name` %>%`  
            `group_by(`r colnames(df_character_select)`) %>%`  
            `summarise(mean(`r colnames(df_numeric_select)`))`  
  
*Assigning the object the same name (i.e. ``r dataframe_name``) will overwrite the object  
  
```{r df_object_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```
  
## Saving a new dataset as a file

To save ``r dataframe_name`_new` as a new file (e.g. csv), run the following:  
  
`write_csv(`r dataframe_name`_new, "`r dataframe_name`_new.csv")`
