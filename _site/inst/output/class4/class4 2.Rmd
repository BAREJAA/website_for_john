## Dealing with strings {.build}
Dealing with character strings is a bit different than dealing with numbers in R?   
  
* Sort?  
* Select?  
* Change?  
  
Fortunately, the `tidyverse` as a package called `stringr` for dealing with them. 

## Stringr
<center><iframe src = "https://stringr.tidyverse.org"></iframe></center>

## Counting strings {.build}
```{r setup_count, include=FALSE}
df_input2 %>% count(string(df_2_col), sort = TRUE) %>% slice(2) %>% select(1) %>% pull()
#restart here
```

`str_count()` is a function we can use to count the number of rows that match a particular pattern.  
  
The output with either be 1 (match), or 0 (no match)  

<div class= "red2"> Example </div>  
In this code:  
- string we want to evaluate is ``r dataframe_join_name`$`r df_2_col``  
- pattern we want to count `"High Cholesterol"`  

`str_count(heart_joined$health_status, "High Cholesterol")`

## Counting
`str_count(heart_joined$health_status, "High Cholesterol")`

```{r str_count example, echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE}
str_count(df_input2[df_2_col], "High Cholesterol")
```

## Summarizing our counts
A bunch of 0 and 1 are not incredibly useful.

But since R is good at adding, we can simply wrap the previous expression in `sum()`  

Try it below:  
```{r sum_string, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Matching subsets of strings {.build}

We previously matched the entire string "High Cholesterol"  
But we can use the same function to detect patterns within longer strings.  
  
Let's look for how many patients take a statin of any kind using
`str_count(heart_joined$medication_hx, "statin")` 

## What about subsets of strings?  
`str_count(heart_joined$medication_hx, "statin")` 

What does the ouput mean?  
```{r str_count_exercise, exercise = TRUE}

```

## A note about string patterns

When using a stringr function, you may get an output saying a string pattern doesn't exist. If you know for sure it does, <div class="blue"> double check capitalization </div>.  
  
**The string must match exactly, or it will not be found!**

## stringr Exercise
How many people having an `"auntie" or "aunt"` in their health history?  
  
Go to code/  
Open 09_stringr.Rmd  
Complete the exercise. 



## Detecting strings {.build}
In addition to counting, we can use another function `str_detect()` to logically evaluate a character string.  
  
Because this logically evaluates an expression, the output is either `TRUE or FALSE`  
  
Practially, `str_detect` is used to detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string  

## Logic Evaluation 
<div class= "red2"> Example </div>  
Find the patients with diabetes using the following code  
  
`str_detect(heart_joined$health_status, "Diabetic")`  
  
```{r strdetect, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Modifiying strings with `str_replace()` {.build}
In the health_status column we have:  
-`"Diabetic"`  
-`"High Cholesterol"`  
-`"Normal blood sugar and cholesterol"`  
  
But let's say we want to simplify healthy individuals to `"Normal"`

`str_replace(heart_joined$health_status, "Normal blood sugar and cholesterol", "Normal")`

```{r str_replace, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Modifiying strings with `str_replace()` {.build}
We use this same code to  modify the `health_status` column by assigning it to the same variable     
  
`heart_joined$health_status <-`  
       `str_replace(heart_joined$health_status, "Normal blood sugar and cholesterol", "normal")`

```{r str_replace in col, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df_input2[df_2_col] <- 
  str_replace(df_input2[df_2_col], "Normal blood sugar and cholesterol", "normal")

head(df_input2[df_2_col], n = 10)
```

## Using `stringr` with `dplyr` {.build}
We can use `stringr` functions in tandem with `dplyr` functions.  
  
<div class= "red2"> Example </div>  
We want to make a logical variable (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) that tells us if a patient has a normal health history using  

`heart_joined2 <- heart_joined %>% mutate(healthy = str_detect(health_status, "normal"))` 

```{r stringr with dplyr, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_input22 <- mutate(df_input2, condition = str_detect(df_2_col, "normal"))

head(df_input22$condition, n = 10)
```
 
## Using Regular Expressions
That solution worked in this case, but was not very elegant, and might not work for all cases (what if there was a 'great aunt' in the list?)  

Or here is a more specific case for this data set.  
  
How many patients have a father with a history of disease? But we don't want to include grandfathers in the results. 
  
We can use something called **Regular Expressions**, aka **Regex**, to solve this

## Using Regular Expressions {.build}
Think of regex as a separate language, with it's own code, syntax, and rules.  
  
Regex rules allow complex matching patterns for strings, to ensure matching *exactly* the content desired
  
It is far too complex to cover in its entirely here, but here is one specific example.  
  
**GOAL**: identify all of the patients that have a father with a history of disease, but excluding grandfathers in the results. 
  
## Regular Expression Example {.build}
<div class="red2"> Example </div>  
We want to start with recognizing `father`.  

But then we want to make sure that we capture both `Father` and `father`. To accept either case f in the first spot we add `(F|f)`, so now our regex looks like `(F|f)ather`  
  
Lastly, we want this pattern to appear at the beginning of the word, so we add the regex `^` symbol.  

Our completed regex looks like:  
  
`str_count(heart_joined$family_history, "^(F|f)ather")` 

```{r regex1, exercise=TRUE}


```
## Regex Exercise
Go to code/  
Open 09_stringr.Rmd  
Complete the exercise to count mothers.

## Importing data into R {.build}

The `readr` package (found in the `tidyverse` collection) contains a number of useful functions of the form `read_*` to import data. For example, if you have a `.csv` file, you would use the `read_csv` function  
  
The dataset provided to you is a cleaned R-specific document. But you will never find this in 'the wild'.  
  
Most often, you will need to find a data file (such as csv), and import it

## Importing data into R {.build}
For the purpose of this class, we have generated a **simulated** dataset of `r dataframe_join_about` to accompany the `r dataframe_name` dataset.  

To import the `r dataframe_join_name` file into RStudio, run the following:  
  
``r dataframe_join_name` <- read_csv(here::here("data", "`r dataframe_join_name`"))`

Go to code/  
Open 08_import_and_join.Rmd  
Complete the exercise to import this new dataset.  

## Importing data into R {.build}

You can also use the `readr` package to import data from a URL

For example, to load a dataset from a URL, run the following

```{r import_url, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
path <- here::here("data", "phx.csv")
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/master/data/phx.csv"
patient_hx <- read_csv(url)

```
## Combining datasets {.build}

There are many times when you have two or more overlapping datasets that you would like to combine

The `dplyr` package has a number of `*_join` functions for this purpose

```{r left_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.height='50%'}
url <- "https://github.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/raw/master/media/dplyr-joins.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```


## `left_join` {.build}

Returns all rows from a, and all columns from a and b

Rows in a with no match in b will have NA values in the new columns

If there are multiple matches between a and b, all combinations of the matches are returned

## `left_join` example {.build}

Take a look at the variables in each dataset - `r dataframe_name` and `r dataframe_join_name`  

You will notice that both datasets contain common variable - `r df_id_name`. This can therefore serve as a common variable to join on. Let's join on this:  
  
`left_join` `r dataframe_name` with `r dataframe_join_name` and assign the output to a new object called ``r dataframe_name`_join_left`

Go to code/  
Open 08_import_and_join.Rmd  
Complete the exercise to join the two datasets.  
  
Now you have one dataset with additional useful information

## `right_join`
```{r right_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.height='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/raw/master/media/dplyr-joins.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```


## `right_join` {.build}
Returns all rows from b, and all columns from a and b

Rows in b with no match in a will have NA values in the new columns

If there are multiple matches between a and b, all combinations of the matches are returned
  
This is conceptually equivalent to a `left_join`, but can be useful when stringing together multiple steps using %>% 

## `inner_join`
```{r inner_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.height='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/raw/master/media/dplyr-joins.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## `inner_join` {.build}
Returns all rows from a where there are matching values in b, and all columns from a and b

If there are multiple matches between a and b, all combination of the matches are returned

## `full_join`
```{r full_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.height='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/raw/master/media/dplyr-joins.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## `full_join` {.build}
Returns all rows and all columns from both a and b  

Where there are no matching values, returns NA for the one missing  
# Concluding Thoughts
