# Slide 1
In this video you will learn how to handle and manipulate strings using the Stringr package

# Slide 2
As the Stringr website states - "Strings are not glamorous, high-profile components of R, but they do play a big role in many data cleaning and preparation tasks"
Working with strings can be challenging, but the Stringr package makes this as painless as possible

# Slide 3
The dataset we will be using is called `happy_long` and contains a subset of the World Happiness Report data

# Slide 4
Here are the first few entries of this dataframe, and we can see that we have a few character variables to work with

# Slide 5
Let's begin by taking a look at the `str_detect()` function. We see this function to detect patterns in a given character variable. So, in this case we want to see which regions have the word "Africa" in their names
- The output is just a bunch of Trues and Falses, which by themselves are of limited value

# Slide 6
Stringr shines when used in conjunction with Dplyr
- For example we can use `str_detect()` within the `filter()` function. Recall that whatever goes inside `filter()` must evaluate to True or False, and we just saw that `str_detect()` produces Trues or Falses
- When we look at the output, we see that we now have a smaller tibble, and this one only contains information for regions in Africa

# Slide 7
Let's take a look at a slightly more complex example
- We can use the "or" symbol to search for two patterns. So this line of code will produce a tibble that only contains rows for the `measurement` terms that contain either the word "ladder" or "life"
- Looking at the output we can verify that this is in fact the case

# Slide 8
Let's take a look at another example of how we can use this package
- Say we have capitalized words that we want to make lower case. We can easilt do this by using the `str_to_lower()` functions
- And the output is just lower case strings

# Slide 9
Again we can use this function along with a Dplyr function, like `mutate()`
- Here we use mutate to convert all the entries in the `region` variable to lower case versions. So we've used mutate here not to create an additional variable but instead to modify an existing one
- Looking at the output we see that all the entries in `region` are now lower case

# Slide 10
And we will end this video with another function - `str_count()`
- Some of the entries in the `measurements` column contain multiple words separated by underscores. Say we wanted to find out what the maximum number of words a given member of this column contains. We could do this by simply counting the number of underscores and adding a 1. We can create a new variable - called `sentence_length` - that contains these numbers, and arrange the resulting tibble in descending order of this new variable
- And we see that the maximum number of words a given `measurements` entry contains is 5

There you go - you are now familiar with a few basic but powerful Stringr functions
