# Introducing `pandas` 
  
pandas is a package that contains a suite of tools that allow you to easily manipulate a data set  

--

Some of the things you can do are -  
- select rows and columns that match specific criteria  
- create new variables (columns)  
- obtain summary statistics on individual groups within your data sets    
  
--

To load the pandas package, run this line of code   
<!-- loading pandas as pd is considered to be standard practice -->

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```
  
---

# Getting to know your data  

--

We will use a dataset called **happy**  

--

Kaggle  

--

Happiness score for each country   

--
---
# World Happiness Report

```{r whr, echo = FALSE}
whr <- tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Description,
  "country_name", "Country name",
  "ladder_score", "Cantril ladder score",
  "gdp", "Log GDP per capita"   ,
  "social_support", "Measure of support (0 or 1)" 
)

whr %>%
  kbl(caption = "Source: Gallup World Poll") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

# What does your DataFrame contain?

Just enter the name of your DataFrame!  
<!-- pandas uses DataFrames. A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types  -->
--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy
```
]
---

---
# Inspecting your DataFrame: dimensions

To see how many rows (observations) and columns (variables) are in **happy**, simply type `happy.shape`  

--

.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.shape
```
]  

---
# Inspecting your DataFrame: Data Types   

To just see what data types your DataFrame contains, you can use the `info()` method  

--

.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.info()
```
]

# Selecting Variables   

---
# Understanding `[]` 
--
.center[
![select](https://github.com/BAREJAA/tidyexplain/blob/master/images/select-multiple-pandas.gif?raw=true)
]
.footnote[Garrick Aden-Buie]
---

# Select a single column  

To select just one column, use square brackets `[]` containing the name of that column in inverted commas  

--

For example, if you only want to select the `country_name` coulmn, run the following code  

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy["country_name"]
```
] 

<!-- **Note:** Each column of a DataFrame is a Series. So when you select just one column, you get back a Series and not a DataFrame  -->
---

# Selecting multiple columns    

To select more than one column, we use a list of the desired column names within `[]`   

--

For example, if you only want to select the `country_name` and `gdp`, you would run the following   

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy[["country_name", "gdp"]]
```
]
---

# Un-selecting a column

To select everything **except** a particular column (e.g. `social_support`), we can use the `drop()` method   

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.drop("social_support", axis = 1)
```
]
---
# Selecting a range of columns  

Finally, if you want to select multiple columns that are in a row, you can use the `loc` operator. For example  

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.loc[: , "country_name":"gdp"]
```
]

# Filter rows based on certain conditions  

If you would like to only keep rows that match a certain condition (e.g. Rows that have a `ladder_score` greater than 4), you can use the `loc` property, like this  

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.loc[happy["ladder_score"] > 4]
```
]
---
# Filter on categorical data  

Filtering can be performed on **categorical** data   
--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.loc[happy["country_name"] == "Spain"]
```
]

<!-- Mention that choosing one row (unlike choosing one column) produces another DataFrame and NOT a Series -->
--

Note that filtering only applies to rows, and has no effect on columns  

---
# Multiple filters  

To filter on multiple conditions, we can use the `query()` method, like this  
--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.query("ladder_score > 5 & gdp < 10")
```
]

---
# Filter and Select

Finally, we can combine filtering rows and selecting columns, again by using the `loc` operator. For example, if we wanted to only keep the countries that have a `ladder_score` above 5, along with just the `country_name` and `ladder_score` columns, we could run this  

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.loc[happy["ladder_score"] > 5, ["country_name", "ladder_score"]]
```
]

# Re-ordering our data

# Sorting rows  

To rearrange the rows of a DataFrame based on the values of a particular column, you can use `sort_values()` method. For example, to change the order of rows of `happy` to go from the lowest `gdp` to the highest, run this code  

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.sort_values(["gdp"])
```
]

---
# Reversing order

By default, `sort_values()` sorts from the lowest to highest values. To reverse this order, set `ascending = False` 

--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy.sort_values(["gdp"], ascending = False)
```
]

---
class: center, middle

# Creating New Variables 

---
# Modify an existing variable

We can modify an existing variable and assign the resulting values to a new variable. For example, say we wanted to create a new column named `social_support_100` that contains the values in `social_support` multiplied by 100. We can do it like this   
--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy["social_support_100"] = happy["social_support"] * 100
happy.head()
```
]

---
# Combining multiple variables

We can even create a new variable by combining two or more existing variables. For example, we can create a new variable called `gdp_ladder_ratio` that contains the values of `gdp` divided by `ladder_score` using the following code  
--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy["gdp_ladder_ratio"] = happy["gdp"] / happy["ladder_score"]
happy.head()
```
]

---

# Summarizing Data 

---
# Calculating summary statistics 

Calculating summary statistics, like the mean or median of a particular column, can easily be done. For example, to calculate the mean `ladder_score` of all the countries in `happy`, run the following code  
--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy["ladder_score"].mean()
```
]

---
# Aggregating by group

Pandas has the powerful method `groupby()` that allows you to summarize data **by group**. To show how this method works, we will make use of the entire dataset - called `happy_full` - that contains additional columns, one of which is called `regional_indicator`  

--

Let's take a look at this full dataset
  
```{python, echo = FALSE}
happy_full.head()
```
---

# `groupby()`

Let's again calculate the mean `ladder_score` but this time by region
--
.panelset[
```{python panelset = TRUE}
happy_full.groupby("regional_indicator")["ladder_score"].mean()
```
]
---
class: center, middle

# Saving Your Work

---
# Saving a new dataset as an object

If you'd like to save the output of your wrangling as an object, you can do so like this 

`mean_happy = happy_full.groupby("regional_indicator")["ladder_score"].mean()`  
 
*Assigning the object the same name (i.e. `happy_full`) will overwrite the object  
---
  
# Saving a new dataset as a file

To save `mean_happy` as a new file (e.g. csv), run the following:  

`mean_happy.to_csv("mean_happy.csv", index = False)`

# Combining data sets

---
# Combining data sets 

There are many times when you have two or more overlapping data sets that you would like to combine  

Pandas offers various ways to combine Series or DataFrames. Let's take a look at how we can perform what are known as **joins** using pandas  

---
# `happy` and `happy_join`

```{python echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
happy
```

--

```{python echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
happy_join
```
