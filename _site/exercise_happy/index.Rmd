## Analysing the World Happiness Report

In this exercise, you will apply what you've learned in class to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **World Happiness Report** and make some pretty plots.  

This dataset was downloaded from the website [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021?select=world-happiness-report.csv). We will use the **2021** data in this exercise. This dataset is stored in an object called `happy_full` 

###  

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* gain quick insight into the type of data this dataset contains
* use functions from the Dplyr package to wrangle your data and obtain useful summaries
* make pretty plots!

### Prerequisites

Please watch the recordings on Dplyr and Ggplot2  

## Take a look at your data

### What does the dataset look like?
