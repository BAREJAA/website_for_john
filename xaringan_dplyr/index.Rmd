Datasets can get very complicated!

---

# R has some simple functions to help you perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

---
# Getting to know your data  

--

We will use a dataset called **happy**  

--

Kaggle  

--

Happiness score for each country   

--
---
# World Happiness Report

```{r whr, echo = FALSE}
whr <- tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Description,
  "country_name", "Country name",
  "ladder_score", "Cantril ladder score",
  "gdp", "Log GDP per capita"   ,
  "social_support", "Measure of support (0 or 1)" 
)

whr %>%
  kbl(caption = "Source: Gallup World Poll") %>%
  kable_styling()
```
---
# What does your dataset contain?

Just enter the name of your dataset!
--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy
```
]
---
# Inspecting your dataframe: dimensions

Use the `dim()` function to see how many rows (observations) and columns (variables) are in **happy**  

`dim(happy)`  

--

.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
dim(happy)
```
]  

---
# Inspecting your dataframe: glimpse

Use the `glimpse()` function to see what kinds of variables the `happy` dataset contains   

--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
glimpse(happy)
```
]

## Basic Data Types in R

R uses different data types -  

--
**character** - `"a"`, `"tidyverse"`    

--
**numeric** - `2`, `11.5`    

--
**integer** - `2L` (the `L` tells R to store this as an integer)    

--
**logical** - `TRUE`, `FALSE`    

--
**complex** - `1+4i`    

--

(**raw**)  

--

You will also come across the **double** datatype. This refers to numbers with decimal points 

--

**factor**. A **factor** is a collection of *ordered* character variables

# (Re)Introducing `%>%`

The `%>%` operator is a way of "chaining" together strings of commands that make reading your code easy  
--

The following code chunk illustrates how `%>%` works:  
  
`happy %>%`  
    `select(country_name, ladder_score) %>%`   
    `filter(country_name == "Panama")` 
    
--
```{r %>% , echo = FALSE}
happy %>% 
  select(country_name, ladder_score) %>% 
  filter(country_name == "Panama")
```
---
    
# (Re)Introducing `%>%` 

The alternative to using `%>%` is running the following code  


`filter(select(happy, country_name, ladder_score), country_name == "Panama")`

--

Although this is only one line as opposed to three, it's both more difficult to write and more difficult to read

# Introducing `dplyr` 
  
dplyr is a package that contains a suite of functions that allow you to easily manipulate a dataset  

--

Some of the things you can do are -  
- select rows and columns that match specific criteria  
- create new variables (columns)  
- obtain summary statistics on individual groups within your datasets  

--

The main verbs we will cover are `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()`. These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation "by group"

]
.footnote[Garrick Aden-Buie]
---
# `select()` specific columns from your dataset 
The most basic `select()` is one where you comma separate a list of columns you want included  


For example, if you only want to select the `country_name` and `gdp` columns, run the following code chunk  
--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  select(country_name, gdp)
```
]
---
# `select()` 

If you want to select all columns *except* `gdp`, run the following  
--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  select(-gdp)
```
]
---
# `select()` 

Finally, you can provide a range of columns to return two columns and everything in between. For example  
--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  select(ladder_score:social_support)
```
]
---
class: center, middle

# `filter()` 

---
# `filter()` rows based on certain condition(s) 

The `filter()` verb evaluates a logical statement, and if a row meets the condition of this statement (i.e. is true) then it gets chosen (or "filtered")    
  
--

**All other rows are discarded**  

---

# `filter()` 

Filtering can be performed on **categorical** data    

--

.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  filter(country_name == "Spain")
```
]  

--

Note that `filter()` only applies to rows, and has no effect on columns  

---
# `filter()`

Filtering can also be performed on **numeric** data    

--

For example, if you wanted to choose `ladder_score` with a value greater than `5`, you would run the following  

.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  filter(ladder_score > 5)
```
]
---
# `filter()` 

To filter on multiple conditions, you can write a sequence of `filter()` commands  

--

.panelset[
```{r panselset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  filter(ladder_score > 5) %>% 
  filter(gdp < 10)
```
]

---
# `filter()` 

To avoid writing multiple `filter()` commands, multiple logical statements can be put inside a single `filter()` command, separated by commas  
--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  filter(ladder_score > 5,
         gdp < 10)
```
]
---

# `arrange()` 

---

# Understanding `arrange()` 
--
.center[
![arrange](https://github.com/BAREJAA/tidyexplain/blob/master/images/arrange.gif?raw=true)
]
.footnote[Garrick Aden-Buie]
---
# `arrange()` sorts rows 

The input for arrange is one or many columns, and `arrange()` sorts the rows in ascending order i.e. from smallest to largest  


For example, to sort rows from smallest to largest in `ladder_score`, run the following  

--

.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  arrange(ladder_score)
```
]  

---
# `arrange()` 

To reverse this order, use the `desc()` function within `arrange()`  

--

.panelset[
```{r panselset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  arrange(desc(ladder_score))
```
]  

---
class: center, middle

# `mutate()` 

---
# `mutate()` 

The `mutate()` verb, unlike the ones covered so far, creates new variable(s) i.e. new column(s). For example  

--

.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  mutate(gdp_sqrt = sqrt(gdp))
```
]  
---
class: center, middle

# `group_by() and summarize()` 

---
# `summarise()` and `summarize()`

`summarize()` is one of the key functions in `dplyr`. It produces a new dataframe that aggregates that values of a column based on a certain condition  

--
  
For example, to calculate the mean `ladder_score`, run the following  

--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy %>% 
  summarize(mean(ladder_score))
```
]
---
# `group_by()` 

`group_by()` and `summarize()` are a powerful combination of functions to summarize by groups 

--

To show off the power of this duo, let's take a look at the entire dataset - called `happy_full` - that contains additional columns, one of which is called `region`  

--

Let's take a look at this full dataset
  
```{r happy_full, echo = FALSE}
head(happy_full)
```
---

# `group_by()`

Let's again calculate the mean `ladder_score` but this time by region
--
.panelset[
```{r panelset = TRUE}
happy_full %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarize(mean(ladder_score))
```
]

# Saving Your Work

---
# Saving a new dataset as an object

If you'd like to save the output of your wrangling as an object, you will need to use the `<-` operator  

`mean_happy <- happy_full %>%`  
                `group_by(region) %>%`   
                `summarize(mean(ladder_score))`  
  
  
*Assigning the object the same name (i.e. `happy_full`) will overwrite the object  
---
  
# Saving a new dataset as a file

To save `mean_happy` as a new file (e.g. csv), run the following:  

  
`write_csv(mean_happy, "mean_happy.csv")`
---
