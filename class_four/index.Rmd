## Dealing with strings {.build}
Dealing with character strings is a bit different than dealing with numbers in R?   
  
* Sort?  
* Select?  
* Change?  
  
Fortunately, the `tidyverse` as a package called `stringr` for dealing with them. 

## Stringr

## Counting strings {.build}
```{r setup_count, include=FALSE}
df_input2 %>% count(string(df_2_col), sort = TRUE) %>% slice(2) %>% select(1) %>% pull()
#restart here
```

`str_count()` is a function we can use to count the number of rows that match a particular pattern.  
  
The output with either be 1 (match), or 0 (no match)  

<div class= "red2"> Example </div>  
In this code:  
- string we want to evaluate is `r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`  
- pattern we want to count is "`r word1`"  

`str_count(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '`r word1`')`  

## Counting
`str_count(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '`r word1`')`

```{r str_count, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Summarizing our counts
A bunch of 0 and 1 are not incredibly useful.

But since R is good at adding, we can simply wrap the previous expression in `sum()`  

Try it below:    
```{r sum_string, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Matching subsets of strings {.build}

We previously matched the entire string "`r word1`" 
But we can use the same function to detect patterns within longer strings.  
  
`str_count(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '`r word2`')`

## What about subsets of strings?  
`str_count(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '`r word2`')`

What does the ouput mean?  
```{r str_count_exercise, exercise = TRUE}

```

## A note about string patterns

When using a stringr function, you may get an output saying a string pattern doesn't exist. If you know for sure it does, <div class="blue"> double check capitalization </div>  
  
**The string must match exactly, or it will not be found!**

## Detecting strings {.build}
In addition to counting, we can use another function `str_detect()` to logically evaluate a character string.  
  
Because this logically evaluates an expression, the output is either `TRUE or FALSE`  
  
Practially, `str_detect` is used to detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string  

## Logic Evaluation 
<div class= "red2"> Example </div>  
Find elements in `r df_2_col` that matches "`r word2`"  

`str_detect(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '`r word2`')`
  
```{r strdetect, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Modifiying strings with `str_replace()` {.build}
In the case of `r df_2_col`, say we want to replace every `r word1` with "IGF1" because `r word1` is incorrect.  

`str_replace(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '`r word1`', 'IGF1')`

```{r str_replace, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Modifiying strings with `str_replace()` {.build}
We use this same code to  modify the `r df_2_col` column by assigning it to the same variable     
  
``r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col` <-`       
       `str_replace(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '`r word1`', 'IGF1')`

```{r str_replace in col, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df_input[df_2_col] <- 
  str_replace(df_input[df_2_col], word1, "IGF1")

head(df_input[df_2_col], n = 10)
```

## Using `stringr` with `dplyr` {.build}
We can use `stringr` functions in tandem with `dplyr` functions.    
  
<div class= "red2"> Example </div>  

`new_df <-` 
  ``r dataframe_name` %>%`  
   `mutate(new_col = str_detect(`r df_2_col`, '`r word2`'))`

```{r stringr_with_dplyr, exercise=TRUE}

```
 
## Using Regular Expressions
What if we wanted to do something more complicated, like search for all elements in a column that being with either "A" or "B"?  
  
We can use something called **Regular Expressions**, aka **Regex**, to solve this

## Using Regular Expressions {.build}
Think of regex as a separate language, with it's own code, syntax, and rules.  
  
Regex rules allow complex matching patterns for strings, to ensure matching *exactly* the content desired
  
It is far too complex to cover in its entirely here, but here is one specific example.    

  
## Regular Expression Example {.build}
<div class="red2"> Example </div>  
Our goal is to identify all elements of `r df_2_col` that begin with either the letter "A" or the letter "B".  

First, we need to specify a pattern that captures this. This pattern is - `(A|B)`.   
  
Then, we want this pattern to appear at the beginning of the word, so we add the regex `^` symbol.    

Our completed regex looks like:    

`str_count(`r dataframe_name`$`r df_2_col`, '^(A|B)')`

```{r regex1, exercise=TRUE}


```

## Importing data into R {.build}

The `readr` package (found in the `tidyverse` collection) contains a number of useful functions of the form `read_*` to import data. For example, if you have a `.csv` file, you would use the `read_csv` function  
  
The dataset provided to you is a cleaned R-specific document. But you will never find this in 'the wild'.  
  
Most often, you will need to find a data file (such as csv), and import it

## Importing data into R {.build}
For the purpose of this class, we have generated a **simulated** dataset of `r dataframe_join_about` to accompany the `r dataframe_name` dataset.  

To import the `r dataframe_join_name` file into RStudio, run the following:  
  
``r dataframe_join_name` <- read_csv("`r dataframe_join_name`.csv")`

## Importing data into R {.build}

You can also use the `readr` package to import data from a URL

For example, to load a dataset from a URL, run the following

```{r import_url, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/master/data/phx.csv"
patient_hx <- read_csv(url)

```

# Combining datasets  

## Combining datasets {.build}

There are many times when you have two or more overlapping datasets that you would like to combine

The `dplyr` package has a number of `*_join` functions for this purpose

## `left_join` {.build}

Returns all rows from `x`, and all columns from `x` and `y`

Rows in `x` with no match in `y` will have NA values in the new columns

If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combinations of the matches are returned

## `left_join` {.build}

```{r left_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="tidyexplain by gadenbuie", out.height='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/master/images/left-join.gif?raw=true"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
  
## `right_join`
```{r right_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="tidyexplain by gadenbuie", out.height='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/master/images/right-join.gif?raw=true"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```


## `right_join` {.build}
Returns all rows from `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`

Rows in `y` with no match in `x` will have NA values in the new columns

If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combinations of the matches are returned
  
This is conceptually equivalent to a `left_join`, but can be useful when stringing together multiple steps using %>% 

## `inner_join`
```{r inner_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="tidyexplain by gadenbuie", out.height='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/master/images/inner-join.gif?raw=true"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## `inner_join` {.build}
Returns all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`

If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combination of the matches are returned

## `full_join`
```{r full_join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="tidyexplain by gadenbuie", out.height='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/master/images/full-join.gif?raw=true"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## `full_join` {.build}
Returns all rows and all columns from both `x` and `y`  

Where there are no matching values, returns NA for the one missing
